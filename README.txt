Everything has been implemented as provided in the project proposal.
The game is fully functional and graphically convenient to use for the user.
The graphical interface has been implemented using tkinter.

Various stack overflow python posts for small python issues.
And of course class notes.

We started a new virtual enviorment after installing anaconda with:
    conda create --name vin python=3

And activated with:
    source activate vin

We found that we needed no pip installs.
Pip freeze did not contradict this as it returned no requirements.

Then we ran:
    python hangman.py

And the project ran correctly.
Following these steps should yield the same result for anyone else.
Also, the new virtual environment is probably not required.
